Booklets
========

A few showcases for how the `pdfpages` package can be used to produce booklets
(or  signatures, in  the case  of longer  documents which  don't sensibly  fit
into  a  booklet)  from  a  child document. Some  modern  printers  have  this
functionality,  but sometimes  one may  wish  to print  a document  in such  a
fashion on  a printer without integrated  booklet support (or, as  has been my
experience, sometimes I'm just not smart  enough to convince the printer to do
the things I want it to do). 

Signatures in particular are not  always easy. Adobe's Acrobat Reader supports
them (or at least it did last time I used it), but particularly for FOSS users
such  as my  humble self,  that is  not always  an option.   Acrobat has  been
unsupported on Linux for  a while now, and it is  unusably unstable these days
for me.

The `pdfpages` package is quite handy for this predicament.

For   a   complete    list   of   options,   check    its   documentation   on
[CTAN](http://ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages).
