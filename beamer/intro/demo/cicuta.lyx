Cicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a small genus of four species
 of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae.
 They are perennial herbaceous plants which grow up to 2.5 meters (8.2 ft)
 tall, having distinctive small green or white flowers arranged in an umbrella
 shape (umbel).
 Plants in this genus may also be referred to as cowbane or poison parsnip.
 Cicuta is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly
 North America and Europe, typically growing in wet meadows, along streambanks
 and other wet and marshy areas.
 These plants bear a close resemblance to other members in the family Apiaceae
 and may be confused with a number of other edible and poisonous plants.
 The common name hemlock may also be confused with poison hemlock (Conium
 maculatum).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants, being
 highly poisonous to humans.[1] Three members of the genus contain a toxin
 named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects
 including seizures following ingestion.
 Medical treatment of poisoning may include the use of activated charcoal
 to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with
 supportive care including anticonvulsant drugs such as a benzodiazepine.
 High doses of anticonvulsant medicine are often required to halt seizure
 activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilati
on may be required.

Cicuta spp.
 are perennial plants that are all similar in morphology, growing up to
 a maximum of 2.5 meters (8.2 ft) in height.
 The stem of the plant is branching, erect, smooth and hollow (except for
 partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem), sometimes being purple-stri
ped, or mottled (typically only C.
 maculata has the purple stripes or spots).
 Attached to the base of the stem is a tuberous root with thickened rootstocks.
 The rootstocks are multichambered and contain a yellowish oily liquid which
 turns reddish brown on exposure to air and emits a characteristic smell
 of raw parsnip.
 The alternate leaves are 2 or 3 pinnately compound and may reach 30 centimeters
 (12 in) to 90 centimeters (35 in) in length.
 The leaflets are lanceolate, serrate, 5 centimeters (2.0 in) to 10 centimeters
 (3.9 in) in length, and sharply toothed.
 The plant flowers in spring or early summer; the flowers are small with
 green or white petals clustered in an umbrella shape (umbel) characteristic
 to this family; the umbel measures 5 centimeters (2.0 in) to 10 centimeters
 (3.9 in) across.
 The plants produce a cylindrical fruit which is 4 millimeters (0.16 in)
 to 6 millimeters (0.24 in) in length.[1][2][3] The plant is spread primarily
 by seeds which are produced in large numbers and are small in size.[2]

Taxonomy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cicuta genus is one of many genera in the Apiaceae family which is in
 the order Apiales.
 The Apiaceae family is also known as Umbelliferae and both of these family
 names are permitted to be used by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclat
ure.[1] In Europe, Cicuta was not distinguished from the similar genus Conium
 before the year 1500.
 The first mention of the genus in the United States was in the eighteenth
 century.[2] Carl Linnaeus formally described three species in 1753.[4] The
 type species is Cicuta virosa.[5] The genus is now recognized to comprise
 four species:[6]

Other species names such as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta
 curtissii are older names now recognized to be varieties of the widespread,
 morphologically variable Cicuta maculata.[3] Cicuta maculata is now recognized
 to have four varieties: var.
 maculata, var.
 augustifolia, var.
 victorinii, and var.
 bolanderi.[6] Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal
 DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems
 to show that C.
 bulbifera and C.
 virosa are monophyletic, while C.
 douglasii may not be.
 It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition
 as a distinct species.[7] Other common names for the genus in general include
 poison parsnip, beaver poison, wild carrot, wild parsnip, and false parsley.[8]

\begin_layout Section
Similar Species
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Members of the family Apiaceae bear close resemblance to each other, and
 have many characteristics in common.
 Cicuta spp.
 are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica),
 wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot
 (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula
 spp.).[1] One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock
 and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like
 umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes
 and rivers.
 Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip
 having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which
 are two or three times compound.
 Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip
 lacks.
 Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower
 cluster, not at the base of the main flower head,[9] while water parsnip
 has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.[10]

Additionally, there can be confusion between the various water hemlock species
 and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum)[11] as the common name hemlock is
 applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum.[12] Both are poisonous and
 can be differentiated by differences in their root structure.
 Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock
 has a single tap root.[1] Another reliable method to identify water hemlock
 is to examine the leaf veins.
 Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins
 which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend
 to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members
 of this family.[2]

\begin_layout Section
Distribution and habitat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cicuta spp.
 are found growing across North America and Europe.
 Typically, they grow in wet habitats usually alongside ponds and streams,
 in marshes or swamps, or areas that are swampy at least part of the year.
 Plants can also be found growing in water.[2][3] Of the four species, Cicuta
 maculata has the most widespread distribution occurring across the majority
 of North America.
 Cicuta bulbifera also has a relatively large distribution, found throughout
 Northern North America.
 Cicuta douglasii is found in the northwest corner of North America, while
 Cicuta virosa is only found in central Europe and in the far north of North
 America.[1][3]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Toxicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All members of Cicuta except C.
 bulbifera contain high levels of the poisonous principle cicutoxin, an
 unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally closely related to the
 toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort.
 Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and in all parts of the plant,
 but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic
 in the early spring.[1] Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant
 in the central nervous system.
 It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist.
 Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel
 which results in neuronal depolarization.
 In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing
 cell overactivity.
 The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures.[1][13] Cicutoxin is
 highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's
 most toxic plants.[1][14] Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and
 there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death
 as early as 1670.[1] A number of people have also died following ingestion
 of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.[8][15][16][17][18][19]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LD50 in mice administered cicutoxin by intraperitoneal injection is
 48.3 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9 mg/kg for mice
 given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD50 for
 arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2 mg/kg.[20] The exact
 toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; it is thought ingestion
 of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small
 amounts may lead to death.[1] Poisoning has been reported following children
 blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants.[21]
 Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant;
 a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto
 the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying.[22] Livestock have
 long been the worst affected, leading to the common name "cowbane".
 Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion
 of roots of the plant.
 In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the
 entire plant out of the ground ingesting both the foiliage and the roots.
 Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings.[2]
 Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little
 as 15 minutes.[23][24][25]

\begin_layout Subsection
Symptoms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon consumption, both in humans and other species, the symptoms of poisoning
 are mainly characterized by generalized seizures.[1] The onset of symptoms
 following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion.
 Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
 tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness;[14][26] although
 the rapid onset of seizure activity may be the first sign presented following
 poisoning.
 Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonicâ€“clonic.[1] Complications
 of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases
 in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood
 coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure.[1]
[27][28] Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium,
 tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, and
 coma.[1][14] Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart
 rate[29] and alternating low and high blood pressure.[30] Other cardiac
 effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval,
 supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.[1][15][31] Symptoms
 of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing
 have also been reported.[1][26]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deaths usually occur from respiratory failure or ventricular fibrillation
 secondary to ongoing seizure activity;[1] fatalities have occurred within
 a few hours of ingestion.[3] Poisoned people who recover usually regain
 consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48 hours of poisoning, although
 seizures may persist for up to 96 hours.[1] There are occasional long-term
 effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication
 and the intoxication itself.[8][26][30][32] Other ongoing mild effects may
 include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety.[1][33] Complete
 resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these
 ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.[1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Diagnosis and treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water hemlock poisoning is usually diagnosed following a history of plant
 ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures.[16][34] Laboratory tests
 to determine the presence of cicutoxin in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry,
 high pressure liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and mass
 spectrometry have been used to detect cicutoxin but these tests are not
 performed routinely in hospital laboratories.[1][35] If a sample of the
 plant ingested has been retained, diagnosis can be confirmed by having
 the plant identified by a botanist.[1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial treatment of poisoning may include gastrointestinal decontamination
 with activated charcoal.[35] Decontamination is typically only performed
 if a potentially toxic amount of plant matter has been ingested up to one
 hour previously and the patient has a normal intact airway or has been
 intubated.[1] There is no specific antidote for water hemlock poisoning
 and treatment mainly consists of supportive care.
 Treatment may include control of seizures with the administration of a
 benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam, or if seizures are refractory
 to this treatment, a barbiturate such as phenobarbital is administered.[1]
 The anticonvulsant phenytoin is not recommended as it has not been shown
 to be effective for seizure control following water hemlock poisoning.[34]
 Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates may cause
 respiratory depression and respiratory support including intubation and
 mechanical ventilation is required in these patients.[1] Continuous electroencep
halography monitoring is recommended in symptomatic patients.[1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further treatment for complications of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis,
 hyperthermia, or low blood pressure may be required.
 Metabolic acidosis is treated by administering sodium bicarbonate.[36] Low
 blood pressure is usually treated with intravenous fluid replacement, but
 the administration of dopamine or norepinephrine may be required to restore
 blood pressure.[1][35] The management of rhabdomyolysis includes ensuring
 adequate hydration and urinary alkalinization; a complication of rhabdomyolysis
 is acute renal failure which may require management with hemodialysis.[1]
 However, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other extracorporeal techniques
 do not remove cicutoxin from the blood and are therefore not useful in
 enhancing elimination.[1][35]
