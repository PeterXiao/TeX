Fonts
=====

Fonts  are a  vast  and complex  topic;  only a  brief  overview is  presented
here. The document focuses on how to switch fonts and font styles.

Besides  that, at  least when  dealing with  pdflatex, two  packages are  very
useful  for  dealing  with  non-ASCII characters:  `inputenc`  and  `fontenc`.
`inputenc` deals  with characters which the  user can input from  the keyboard
(say,  umlauts), while  `fontenc` deals  with the  things needed  for properly
outputting special characters.

If you ever have trouble with special characters, the following pages might be
of interest:

- [Stackexchange: fontenc vs inputenc](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/44699)
- [Wikibooks: LaTeX/Special Characters](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters)
- [Wikibooks: LaTeX/Fonts](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Fonts)
- For XeTeX and LuaLaTeX, the [Fontspec Package](http://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec)
  could be worth a look.
