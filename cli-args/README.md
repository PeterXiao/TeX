Command Line Arguments
======================

Passing  command line  arguments  to  a makefile  and  to  a tex  file. Highly
experimental. Potentially stupid. Certainly silly.


Compatibility
-------------

Only works with GNU Make so far.


TODO
----

- Clean out makefile before auto-generating new targets
- `make gen` should give out reminder to include all chapters in the master file
- `make help` ?
