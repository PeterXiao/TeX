Block Diagrams
==============

Some block diagrams I've created over the eons.

Content
-------

`dataFlow.tex`   and  `sensorProcess.tex`   are  about   a  year   older  than
`latexWorkflow.tex`  and `texOverview.tex`. So  while they  are bigger,  their
code  is probably  of  lesser quality. Not  that I'm  claiming  the two  newer
pictures follow the most superb of coding practices.

Building
--------

* `make data`: compiles `dataFlow.tex`
* `make sensor`: compiles `sensorProcess.tex`
* `make workflow`: compiles `latexWorkflow.tex`
* `make overview`: compiles `texOverview.tex`
* `make all`: compiles everything
* `make clean`: clean out auxiliary and log files, keep pdf files
