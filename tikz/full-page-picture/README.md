Full-Page Pictures
==================

A way to  get a picture to  fill the entire page, using  Ti*k*Z. Note that the
document must be  compiled twice for the positioning  to work correctly. Also,
it does, at least for me, not work with XeTeX.

`make` will  by default compile the  document twice. `make clean`  removes the
auxiliary and log files.
